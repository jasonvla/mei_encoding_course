# Report
In this repository, I am presenting both my files and a report where I comment on what worked out and what did not.

(Disclaimer: **I did not use any kind of AI in order for the encoding to work**. During the last lecture, I tried a few prompts and the results were not good at all. So I decided to not include it into my workflow at all, solely relying on the Guidelines and the things we've learned during the course.)

#### Motivation
- Why choose this piece?
- Challenges during the course

#### Issues with the encoding
- What does not work and why? Compare comments in the mei-document
- What did I try to fix it?
