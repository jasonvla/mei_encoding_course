# Report
In this repository, I am presenting both my files and a report where I comment on what worked out and what did not.

(Disclaimer: **I did not use any kind of AI in while creating the encoding**. During the last lecture, I tried a few prompts and the results were not good at all. So I decided to not include it into my workflow at all, solely relying on the Guidelines and the things we've learned during the course.)

### Motivation

When we were told to look up a suitable piece to encode, I wanted to find something that a) included new concepts I haven't used in MEI yet and b) is not longer than 20 measures. After doing a little bit of research, I decided to try the *VI.* from *Schoenbergs Sechs kleine Klavierstücke, Op.19*. At first glance, I already discovered several things that I knew would become difficult to encode, such as the additional third line during the last few measures, multiple layers within the staves (partially even within triplets), etc.
In my opinion it is a perfect piece to practice key concepts of MEI music encoding because of its high density of encoding questions covered in only a handful of measures.


### What worked well
In general, I am positively surprised how much can be done in MEI despite not being very experienced in terms of music encoding.  
- notes and chords
- adding slurs and ties (mostly with xml ids or sometimes tstamps works better)
- placing dynamics
- placing accents
- adding metadata
- learnt encoding exact positions with @vo and @ho


### Problems

- What does not work and why? Compare comments in the mei-document
- What did I try to fix it?

e.g. 
- fonts 
- determine exact positions
